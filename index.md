# Problem of the Week

As the name suggests, the Problem of the Week is a weekly problem released to the masses - **you**. You solve the problem __SHOWING ALL WORK__, submit it, then repeat. Your problem is scored based on your work and solution and you’re given a score. Every week, you compete against your friends and enemies to score the most points and win competition titles. There will be prizes awarded quarterly and a grand prize awarded at the end of the year. Problems will cover every area of math you have studied and some that you haven’t. Learning math on-the-fly as you do these problems is encouraged; posting on forums or utilizing unauthorized help to is not. Everyone has a chance at winning, so don’t be shy; solve some more!

# Competition
The Problem of the Week competition takes place over the entire school year with semesterly prizes as titles given to those who win prizes. These prizes will be in the form of gift cards. Your rank will be determined by the number of points you score and it will be updated as each problem is graded. Each Problem of the Week will be posted at the start of the week on Schoology. You have a week to complete each problem and submit it. Each problem will be graded at latest two weeks after it is posted. On each problem page is linked the submission form. You can only submit a Word document, image, or PDF answer and will be awarded credit based on your work and your solution - again, __YOU WILL GET NO POINTS IF YOU DO NOT SHOW YOUR WORK__. You submit your answers weekly at the link below:
